I am a postdoctral scientist working at the department Sun and Heliosphere, Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research.
My research topics here can be categorized into two parts. First, I work on the analysis and dissemination of Solar Orbiter PHI data to the public, which involves utilizing existing tools as well as developing custom data analysis routines. Also, I plan to use the extensive and ever-expanding dataset from the Solar Orbiter instruments (e.g., PHI, EUI, SPICE, and Metis) to explore the physics on the sun. Specifically, I focus on examining the structures of the photospheric magnetic field and their impact on solar activities and coronal heating based on both observational data and simulations.
