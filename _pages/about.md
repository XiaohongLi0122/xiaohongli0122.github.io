I am a postdoctral scientist working in CmPA, Department of Mathematics, KU Leuven.
My research focuses on using both obervational tools and numerical simulation tools to explore the physics on the sun.
Particularly, I am interested in solar jets, e.g., small amplitude energetic events on the solar lower atmosphere, and coronal rain, e.g., the thermal circulation processes on the solar corona.
